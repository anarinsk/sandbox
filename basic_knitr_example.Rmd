Knitr Basic Example
===================

How do I have a random number be reproducible?

``` {r }
set.seed(123)
rnorm(10)
````


Make cool graphics we can share the code for.  We'll use some inline code to turn on `knitr's` upload function: `r opts_knit$set(upload = TRUE) `


``` {r }
library(ggplot2)
qplot(hp, mpg, data=mtcars)+geom_smooth()
ggpcp(mtcars) + geom_line()
````



## Libraries

These libraries will load without printing any messages to the output. 

``` {r message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(geiger)
````
